/* imp note  ---->   
let :
    1) let is only can acess in his block 
    2) if let is define in function scope then it is local varible on this function
    3) let can be modified 
    

const:
    1) can't be modified
    2) only can acess in his block 


var:
    1) can be modified
    2) var is the function scope means we can acess it under the scope of function 
    3) if we make any varibale using var under some block(Ex:under if)  then it is act as a global variable
